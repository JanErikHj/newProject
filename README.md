A zsh script to make setting up a new project quicker

Language options: c++, python, zsh, bash

1. Copies template folder based on language to source directory
2. Initializes git in the new project directory
3. Creates remote repo on github and pushes main to remote
4. Opens project in VS Code (Consider removing this...)


ToDo:
- Make remote git repo optional
- Make open in VS Code optional
- Add creation of Obsidian Project Notes
